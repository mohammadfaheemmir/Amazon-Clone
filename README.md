# Amazon-Clone
This project is an Amazon clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It aims to replicate the user interface and experience of the Amazon website without the full functionality. While it lacks the cart functionality, it provides users with the ability to browse products, view product details, and navigate through different categories.
